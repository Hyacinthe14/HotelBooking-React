# Hotel Booking System Technical Documentation

## Architecture Overview

The project is built using a modern React stack with TypeScript and Vite, emphasizing type safety and rapid development. 

### Core Technologies
- React 18.x
- TypeScript
- Vite
- ESLint with TypeScript support
- SWC for Fast Refresh

## Authentication System

### Password Recovery Flow
The `ForgotPasswordPage` component implements a secure password recovery system with:

- Email validation
- Interactive UI feedback
- Success/Error state management
- Form submission handling

### Security Features
- Form submission prevention with `e.preventDefault()`
- Type-safe event handling
- Controlled form inputs
- State management for user feedback

## UI/UX Features

### Interactive Elements
The project includes advanced UI features like:

1. Dynamic hover effects using CSS custom properties:
   - Mouse position tracking
   - Real-time style updates
   - Smooth transitions

2. Animated feedback:
   - Success notifications
   - Error alerts
   - Loading states

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Bootstrap grid system integration
- Flexible container layouts
- Offset column positioning

## State Management
- React hooks for local state
- Custom hooks for authentication (`useAuthRedirect`)
- Typed state variables
- Controlled form components

## Code Organization

### Directory Structure

### Component Architecture
- Functional components with TypeScript
- React.FC type definitions
- Proper event typing
- Props interface definitions

## Development Workflow

### ESLint Configuration
- Type-aware lint rules
- React-specific ESLint plugins
- Strict type checking
- Style enforcement

### Build System
- Vite for development and production builds
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- Fast refresh support
- Optimized asset handling

## Testing Strategy
- Type checking through TypeScript
- Event handler testing
- Form submission validation
- UI state verification

## Performance Considerations
- Optimized re-renders
- Event delegation
- Proper state management
- Efficient DOM updates

## Future Enhancements
1. Integration with backend services
2. Enhanced form validation
3. Additional authentication methods
4. Extended UI component library
